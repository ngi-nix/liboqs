# liboqs
liboqs is an open source C library for quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms. 

liboqs provides: 

* A collection of open source implementations of quantum-safe key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) and digital signature algorithms; the full list can be found below 
* A common API for these algorithms 
* A test harness and benchmarking routines 

liboqs is part of the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project led by [Douglas Stebila](https://www.douglas.stebila.ca/research/) and [Michele Mosca](http://faculty.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/mmosca/), which aims to develop and integrate into applications quantum-safe cryptography to facilitate deployment and testing in real world contexts. In particular, OQS provides prototype integrations of liboqs into TLS and SSH, through [OpenSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl) and [OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable).

More information on OQS can be found [here](https://openquantumsafe.org/) and in the [associated](https://openquantumsafe.org/papers/SAC-SteMos16.pdf) [whitepapers](https://openquantumsafe.org/papers/NISTPQC-CroPaqSte19.pdf).
